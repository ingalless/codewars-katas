# Katas (codewars.com)

These are my katas for codewars.com.
I found it much more natural to author my solution in my own editing environment.

## Adding a kata

Using [just](https://just.systems/man/en/) run:
```bash
just new folder

just open # Need fzf and nvim
```

At this point, you can copy the code from codewars.com into `src/lib.rs`.
Some of the solutions use `src/main.rs`.
